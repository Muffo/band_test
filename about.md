## About

### What
A collection of music from underground bands that no longer exist.

### Why
Make the music available to everyone and make sure it doesn't get lost forever.

### How
A website where people can download the audio files and listen for free.

### Who
A webmaster (me) and a network of people to gather the audio files.

### Where
Name of the website is still tbd. I am thinking to use "something".band, e.g. archived.band.
If you have ideas, see what's available [here](https://domains.google.com/m/registrar/search)

### Scope
Limit only to Italian band. We host only audio files of bands that are not available elsewhere. Add only a link if already on Spotify.

### To discuss
* Ads in the website? Maybe to pay for web server expenses
* Include Youtube videos?
* Should the website be in Italian?
* Any problem with copyright?

### Help needed
* Contact people
* Collect the music files
* Moderate the comments section
* Promote the project on social media
